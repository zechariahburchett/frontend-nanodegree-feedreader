# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The first test suite 'RSS Feeds' was completed for me and I had to create code to complete the rest of the suites.

# Steps Required To Run Application
1. The allFeeds object must be defined and must not be empty.
2. Each feed in the `allFeeds` object must have a URL defined and the URL cannot be empty.
3. Each feed in the `allFeeds` object must have a name defined and  the name cannot be empty.
4. The menu element is hidden by default and should toggle visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
5. When the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within  the `.feed` container.
6. When a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function the content changes.
